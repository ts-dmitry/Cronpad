        (Copied text) HoursTracker is a great choice for people interested in an accurate work time tracker app. If your
        employees are
        following a busy schedule and donâ€™t have time to do manual entries, you should introduce them to HoursTracker.

        The app can track employee hours and earnings, business expenses, payment periods and breaks. It comes with a
        user-friendly interface, allowing employees to instantly clock in and clock out. The app can track hours
        automatically based on whether they are arriving at or leaving their job location.
